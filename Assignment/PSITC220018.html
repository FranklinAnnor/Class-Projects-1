    My Experience
  </h2><img class="AC"   src="../Assignment/Big Akwasi.jpg" alt="">
  <p>I have two years experience in a company called<strong> Ghana Web Designs</strong>.  During that time I was working as a <strong>Young Assistant Developer</strong>  for about a year. The duties I was giving was very interesting , I had the opportunity to learn more skill and new ways of doing things as a developer including the way I think this is because to be a developer I have to think like one. I had the opportunity to work more on <strong>CSS ,HTML and JAVASCRIPT</strong>. I also had the opportunity to meet some of the Gurus who have being in that field for so many years; they taught me a lot of things and invested more ideas in me.  A year later,I had a transfer to work as <strong>Database management Co-Assistance</strong> in that same company. That field helped me a lot to understand how database work , how file system management also work and how to generate information out of a collected data. With the passion and dedication I opened up to learn due to this I was able to meet the demand placed on me and I and my were able to complete task on time, because of hard work and we were awarded a bonus. I realized that I can work under pressure, so at that time I got to know my self more and more.<strong> I was able to develop my communication skills very well , socialization skills and so on.</strong>This shows how entertained my experience was thank you so much for your time.    | <a href="#a" target="_top" >Link To My Profile  </a>|<a href="#b" target="_top" >Link To My Hobbies </a>| </p>
